# 109A-Praxis-3-Repo

In this Repository, the code for the final Project of ESC 202 can be found. 

In this project an automatic garbage can was built, allowing for the safe disposal of needles. 

Features of the device:
- Automatically locks when the sensors detect that the bin is full.
- Requires the use of two hands to operate, preventing of theft from the biohazardous waste inside it.
- Connects to a simple website that logs the status of the garbage bin each time something new is disposed inside it.
